# Open Contracting Budgets and Spend Extension

The Open Contracting Data Standard Budgets and Spend Extension is under development to assist data publishers and users in making the connection between budget, contacting and spend monitoring processes.

A [discussion paper on the proposed extension approach is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b43JeG5YQ62tGTTbP7jTE4XqUxYzG-r-emgRILZPRn4/edit). 

This repository is under active development, and currently contains a [worked example](examples/) of how this extension can be used to record yearly financial commitments to a contracting process and individual contracts.
